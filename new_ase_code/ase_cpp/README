Code useful for allele-specific analyses. 
Ase can be used to assign aligned reads to the maternal or paternal haplotype or to count
reads on heterozygous SNPs. 

To build (assuming a Linux environment):
- You should have cmake and the Boost C++ library (http://www.boost.org/).
- Get all the contents of this directory (src, Makefile, CMakeLists, configure, ase_release.tgz). 
- Extract ase_release.tgz. Its contents should be in the same directory as src, say $ASE_ROOT. This
contains 
- If build/release or build/debug contain a CMakeCache.txt file, remove it (this might be necessary
if you did any failed compile attempts).
- Type ./configure.sh.
- Type make.
