Code useful for allele-specific analyses. 
Ase can be used to assign aligned reads to the maternal or paternal haplotype or to count
reads on heterozygous SNPs. 

To build: 
- You should have cmake and the Boost C++ library (http://www.boost.org/).
- Get all the contents of this directory (src, Makefile, configure.sh, ase_release.tgz). 
- Extract ase_release.tgz. Its contents should be in the same directory as src, say $ASE_ROOT.
- Type ./configure.sh.
- Type make.
