Code for mapping to personal genomes from the chromatin variation project (Kasowski et al. 2013). 

Main update: Code now works on the scg3 cluster (i.e. on an sge-based cluster.

An example for how to run the code is found in testFiles/testRun.sh

new_ase_code/bin
Mostly preprocessing stuff (alignment/cleaning up of reads, peak calling, signal track
generation, QC etc). In many cases there's two scripts with similar names (eg. alignSample.sh and
alignBatch.sh). In these cases, the "Sample" script does the actual work. The "Batch" script reads
metadata (such as cell line name, factor name etc) and submits jobs that call the "Sample" script.

new_ase_code/ase/python
Code for creating personal genomes (the add*Snps* files). Various other utilities.
